"""
This module represents a stationary battery.

*****
Scope
*****
Batteries are crucial in effectively integrating high shares of renewable
energy electricity sources in diverse energy systems. They can be particularly
useful for off-grid energy systems, or for the management of grid stability
and flexibility. This flexibility is provided to the energy system by the
battery in times where the electric consumers cannot.

*******
Concept
*******
The battery component has an electricity bus input and output, where factors
such as the charging and discharging efficiency, the loss rate, the C-rates
and the depth of discharge define the electricity flows.

    Fig.1: Simple diagram of a battery storage.

Wanted storage level
--------------------
Within this component, there is the possibility to choose a wanted
storage level that the energy system should try to maintain when it
feasibly can. If the state of charge level wanted is defined, the variable
artificial costs change depending on whether the storage level is above or
below the desired value. If the battery level is too low, the artificial
costs of storing electricity into the battery can be reduced and the costs
of extracting electricity from the battery can be increased to incentivise
the system to maintain the wanted storage level.

Maximum chargeable/dischargeable energy
---------------------------------------
The maximum chargeable and dischargeable energy [Wh] per timestep is dependant on
the C-rate and the state of charge of the battery. Because of the charging losses
defined by charging efficiency, the nominal value of the input flow must be higher
than what is actually entering the battery in order to ensure that the battery can
be fully charged in one time step. Due to the *inflow_conversion_factor*
parameter (in :func:`~smooth.components.component_battery.Battery.create_oemof_model`),
the battery will then receive the right amount.

.. math::
    E_{in,max} = \\frac{min(c_{r,charge} \\cdot C \\cdot \\frac{t}{60},
    C - SOC \\cdot C)}{\\mu_{charge}} \n
    E_{out,max} = min(c_{r,discharge} \\cdot C \\cdot \\frac{t}{60}, SOC \\cdot C)

* :math:`E_{in,max}` = maximum chargeable energy [Wh]
* :math:`c_{r,charge}` = C-Rate [-/h]
* :math:`C` = storage capacity [Wh]
* :math:`SOC` = state of charge [Wh]
* :math:`\\mu_{charge}` = charging efficiency [-]
* :math:`E_{out,max}` = maximum dischargeable energy [Wh]
