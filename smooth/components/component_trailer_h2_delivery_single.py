"""
This module represents a hydrogen trailer delivery from a single
production site.

*****
Scope
*****
Hydrogen trailers can be crucial in an energy system as a means of transporting
hydrogen from the production site to the destination site (e.g. a refuelling
station).

*******
Concept
*******
Similarly to the hydrogen trailer component with multiple production sites, the
single hydrogen trailer component is a transformer component with a hydrogen
bus input and a hydrogen bus output, which should be distinct from each other in
order to maintain a one way flow from the production site to the destination site.

    Fig.1: Simple diagram of a hydrogen delivery trailer

The only difference between this component and the hydrogen trailer component is
that here, there is only one option for the origin storage and this is
predetermined. This component should be used in parallel with the trailer gate
component. The amount of hydrogen that can be transported in a given time step
is determined, and this value restricts the flow in the component. A simple
depiction of how the concept for the single hydrogen delivery trailer is shown in
Figure 2.

Trailer activity
----------------
Thresholds are set for both the origin and destination storages. The component
then:

* Checks the level of destination storage component: if it is below specified
  threshold, low artificial costs are implemented (to encourage system to fill it).
* Checks the level of origin storage component: if it is below specified
  threshold, the trailer cannot take any hydrogen from it.
* Checks the mass of hydrogen in both storages along with taking the trailer
  capacity into consideration, and transports the maximum possible amount of
  hydrogen.
* Considers the round trip distance along with the assumptions that the
  trailer can travel at 100 km/h and that the refuelling time for the trailer
  is 15 minutes. With this information, it is determined whether or not
  delivery is possible for the following time step with the trailer.
