"""
A gate component is created to transform a specific bus into a more
general bus.

*****
Scope
*****
The gate component is a virtual component, so would not be found in a real life
energy system, but is used in the framework as a means of transforming a
specific bus into a more general bus. As an example, it could be useful in an
energy system to initially differentiate between the electricity buses coming
out of each renewable energy source, but at some point in the system it could
become more useful to have only one generic electricity bus defined.

*******
Concept
*******
An oemof Transformer component is used to convert the chosen input bus into the
chosen output bus, with a limitation on the value that can be transformed
per timestep by the defined maximum input parameter.
