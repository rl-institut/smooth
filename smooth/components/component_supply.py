"""
A generic supply component (usually for grid supplied electricity, heat etc.) is
created through this class.

*****
Scope
*****
A supply component is a generic component that represents a supply to the energy
system such as an electricity grid or a hydrogen grid.

*******
Concept
*******
The output bus type and
the maximum output per timestep are defined by the user, and similarly to in
the sink component, the default maximum output value is set to very high to
represent a limitless capacity.

Artificial costs
----------------
There are some energy systems where the supply component should be incentivised
to be used in certain scenarios and not in others. As an example, an energy
system with renewable energy electricity production, the electricity grid as
an alternative supply and hydrogen production/storage is considered. \n

If the hydrogen storage is over a defined threshold, then the system wants to
prioritise using the stored hydrogen as an energy source instead of extracting
energy from the grid, which is achieved by setting high artificial costs on
the use of the grid component. If the hydrogen storage is below the defined
threshold, however, then the system is incentivised to use the grid so that
the storage does not entirely run out.
