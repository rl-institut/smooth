"""
This module represents a hydrogen trailer delivery from multiple
production sites.

*****
Scope
*****
Hydrogen trailers can be crucial in an energy system as a means of transporting
hydrogen from the production site to the destination site (e.g. a refuelling
station).

*******
Concept
*******
The hydrogen trailer component is a transformer component with a hydrogen
bus input and a hydrogen bus output, which should be distinct from each other
in order to maintain a one way flow from the production site to the destination
site.

    Fig.1: Simple diagram of a hydrogen delivery trailer

This component should be used in parallel with the trailer gate
component. The amount of hydrogen that can be transported in a given time step is
determined, and this value restricts the flow in the component. A simple
depiction of how the concept for the single hydrogen delivery trailer is shown in
Figure 2.

Trailer activity
----------------
In this component, the trailer has the option of transporting hydrogen from
multiple production sites to one destination. Thresholds are set for both
the origin and destination storages. The component then:

* Checks the level of destination storage component: if it is below specified
  threshold, low artificial costs are implemented (to encourage system to fill it).
* Checks the level of the origin storage components and chooses the one with
  maximum available mass of hydrogen
* Takes into consideration the mass of hydrogen in the chosen origin storage
  component and the destination storage, as well as the trailer capacity, and
  transports the maximum possible amount of hydrogen.
* Considers the round trip distance along with the assumptions that the
  trailer can travel at 100 km/h and that the refuelling time for the trailer
  is 15 minutes. With this information, it is determined whether or not
  delivery is possible for the following time step with the trailer.
