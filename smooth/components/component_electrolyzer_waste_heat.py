This module is created as a subclass of the alkaline Electrolyzer module with
the inclusion of a waste heat model.

*****
Scope
*****
The significance of including the heat generation from an electrolyzer in an
energy system is that this heat can be utilized for other means (e.g.
contributing towards a heat demand) as opposed to wasted. This will be
particularly important with the implementation of large scale electrolyzers,
where there is the potential to recover large quantities of energy.

*******
Concept
*******
In this component, it is assumed that the alkaline electrolyzer consists of a
cylindrical cell stack along with two cylindrical gas separators. It is further
assumed that:

* The cell stack height consists of the cells plus two ends. The height of the
  end of the stack which is not part of the cells has a dependence on the diameter
  of the cell. The ratio is taken as 7:120 [1]
* The height of an individual cell is in a ratio of 1:75.5 with the cell
  diameter [2]
* The overall surface area exposed by the gas separators and the pipe
  communicating them is in a ratio of 1:0.42 with the surface area of the stack [3]

    Fig.1: Simple diagram of an alkaline electrolyzer with waste heat.

The alkaline electrolyzer with waste heat intakes an electrical flow and outputs
hydrogen and thermal energy flows. The behaviour of the electrolyzer waste heat
model is non-linear, which is demonstrated through the use of oemof's Piecewise
Linear Transformer component.

Waste heat
----------
The waste heat equation is derived from the heat balance equation, found in [3].
From this equation, it is shown that the change of the electrolyzer temperature
comes from the electrical power input dissipated as heat, without the inclusion
of the heat losses to the environment, the heat removed by the cooling water,
and the sum of the enthalpy leaving the system with the hydrogen and oxygen
streams and the enthalpy gained from the deionized water to warm up the
electrolyzer from ambient to operating temperature [3]:

.. math::
    C_t \\cdot \\frac{dT}{dt} = P_{heat} - Q_{loss} - Q_{cooling} - h_j \\cdot m_j

#ToDo: sort out this equation including derivatives etc.

For the waste heat model in SMOOTH, the heat balance is assumed for
stationary conditions. This is because the model only applies when the
maximum temperature is reached, and this temperature is then kept constant
because of the removal of the waste heat from the system.

The waste heat, which is removed from the electrolyzer by the cooling water,
is calculated using the following equation, based on [3]:

.. math::
    Q_W = Q_{gen} - Q_L + L + S

* :math:`Q_{W}` = waste heat
* :math:`Q_{gen}` = internal heat generation
* :math:`Q_{L}` = heat losses to the environment
* :math:`L` = latent heat
* :math:`S` = sensible heat

Internal heat generation
------------------------
The internal heat generation within an electrolyzer is as a result of a greater
energy supply to the electrolyzer than is required . This is
necessary for reaching high water electrolysis rates [3]. The internal heat
gemeration is calculated as follows:

.. math::
   Q_{gen} = E_{sup} - H_{2,prod} \\cdot HHV_{H_{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1e6}{3600}

* :math:`E_{sup}` = total energy supply to the electrolyzer
* :math:`H_{2,prod}` = the amount of hydrogen produced
* :math:`HHV_{H_{2}}` = the higher heating value of hydrogen

Heat losses
-----------
In order to calculate the heat losses to the environment, the heat transfer
coefficient is first calculated based on [3]. It should be noted that the
following equation is specifically to determine the heat transfer coefficient
for horizontal cylinders, and since the parts of the alkaline have a cylindrical
shape, this equation is used for the alkaline electrolyzer component:

.. math::
  h = 1.32 \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta T}{d}^{0.25}

The heat losses are then calculated taking into consideration the heat
transfer coefficient, the total surface area of the main parts of the
electrolyzer (the cell stack and the gas separators) and the temperature
difference between the surface of the electrolyzer and the ambient temperature [3].
The equation is as follows:

.. math::
    Q_L = A_{sep} \\cdot h \\cdot (T_{sep} - T_{amb}) + A_{stack} \\cdot h
    \\cdot (T_{stack} - T_{amb})

* :math:`A_{sep}` = total surface area of the gas separators
* :math:`T_{sep}` = separator surface temperature
* :math:`T_{amb}` = ambient temperature
* :math:`A_{stack}` = total surface area of the cell stack
* :math:`T_{stack}` = cell stack surface temperature

Sensible and latent heat
------------------------

**Sensible heat** \n
The sensible heat removed from the system within the :math:`H_2` and :math:`O_2` streams,
as well as the sensible heat required to warm the deionized water from ambient
temperature to the stack operating temperature, must be considered when determining
the total waste heat. From the known mass of produced hydrogen along with the
molar masses of :math:`H_2` and :math:`O_2`, the mass of produced oxygen is
determined:

.. math::
    m_{O_{2}} = m_{H_{2}} \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot \\frac{M_{O_{2}}}{M_{H_{2}}}

* :math:`m_{O_{2}}` = mass of oxygen stream
* :math:`m_{H_{2}}` = mass of hydrogen stream
* :math:`M_{O_{2}}` = molar mass of oxygen
* :math:`M_{H_{2}}` = molar mass of hydrogen

The mass of :math:`H_2O` is then determined as follows:

.. math::
    m_{H_{2O}} = m_{H_{2}} + m_{O_{2}}

* :math:`m_{H_{2O}}` = mass of water

Thus, the sensible heat is calculated using mass and specific heat:

.. math::
    S = \\frac{m_{H_{2}O} \\cdot c_{p,H_{2}O} \\cdot -\\Delta T - m_{H_{2}} \\cdot
     c_{p,H_{2}} \\cdot \\Delta T + m_{O_{2}} \\cdot c_{p,O_{2}} \\cdot \\Delta T}{3.6e6}

* :math:`c_{p,H_{2}O}` = specific heat of water
* :math:`\\Delta T` = the temperature change between the ambient and electrolyzer temperature
* :math:`c_{p,H_{2}}` = specific heat of hydrogen
* :math:`c_{p,O_{2}}` = specific heat of oxygen

**Latent heat** \n

The latent heat is neglected since the mass of :math:`H_{2O}` vapor
(leaving the system with the oxygen and hydrogen streams) is neglected.

Piecewise Linear Transformer
----------------------------
Currently, the piecewise linear transformer component in oemof can only
represent a one-to-one transformation with a singular input and a singular
output. Thus, in order to represent the non-linear behaviour of the alkaline
electrolyser in the energy system, two oemof components are created for the
hydrogen and thermal outputs individually, with a constraint that the electric
input flows into each component must always be equal. In this way, the individual
oemof components behave as one component.
