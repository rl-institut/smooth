"""
This module represents a hydrogen trailer delivery from a single
production site to one main destination site, and a secondary
destination site that is dependent on the main site when
necessary.

*****
Scope
*****
Hydrogen trailers can be crucial in an energy system as a means of transporting
hydrogen from the production site to the destination site (e.g. a refuelling
station). Sometimes it is the case that one production site should supply
hydrogen to destination sites that are in close proximity to each other, for
instance. If this is the case, it is beneficial for the energy system
productivity to supply to both storages in one trip. This component represents
a case where there is one main destination site that needs regular delivery,
and one secondary destination site that will receive a delivery in the same
trip as to the main destination site when necessary.

*******
Concept
*******
The cascade hydrogen trailer component is also a transformer component with a
hydrogen bus input and output that are distinct from each other. This component
should be used in parallel with the trailer gate and trailer gate cascade
components. The amount of hydrogen that can be transported in a given time step
is determined, and this value restricts the flow in the component.

Trailer activity
----------------
In this component, the trailer has the option of transporting hydrogen
from one production site to two destination sites that are dependent
on one another. Thresholds are set for the origin and destination storages.
The component then:

* Checks the level of the origin storage component: if it is below specified
  threshold, the trailer cannot take hydrogen from it.
* Checks the level of destination storage components: if they are both below
  their specified thresholds, then the trailer is incentivised to deliver
  to both storages.
* Checks the mass of hydrogen in all storages as well as the trailer
  capacity, and transports the maximum possible amount of hydrogen.
* Calculates how much hydrogen should get delivered to the main and
  secondary destination storages, prioritising filling up the main
  storage when necessary.
