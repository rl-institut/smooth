SMOOTH stands for "Simulation Model for Optimized Operation and Topology of
Hybrid energy systems". This tool serves to minimise costs and maximise the
sustainability of dynamic energy systems. The key features of SMOOTH are:

  * The real world energy system is reduced to its relevant components
  * Detailed modelling of components including non-linear component behaviour,
    state-dependent component behaviour and tracking arbitrary states of the
    components
  * Stepwise simulation without using perfect foresight
  * Parameter optimization possible in combination with a genetic algorithm

See the [documentation](https://smooth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for details.
